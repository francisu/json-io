**json-io** consists of two main classes, a reader (`JsonReader`) and a writer (`JsonWriter`).  **json-io** eliminates 
the need for using `ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream` to serialize Java and instead uses the JSON format.  There 
is a 3rd optional class (`JsonObject`) see 'Non-typed Usage' below.

**json-io** does not require that Java classes implement `Serializable` or `Externalizable` to be serialized, 
unlike `ObjectInputStream` / `ObjectOutputStream`.  It will serialize any Java object graph into JSON and retain 
complete graph semantics / shape and object types.  This includes supporting private fields, private inner classes 
(static or non-static), of any depth.  It also includes handling cyclic references.  Objects do not need to have 
public constructors to be serialized.  The output JSON will not include `transient` fields, identical to the 
ObjectOutputStream behavior.

The `JsonReader / JsonWriter` code does not depend on any native or 3rd party libraries.

### Format
**json-io** uses proper JSON format.  As little type information is included in the JSON format to keep it compact as 
possible.  When an object's class can be inferred from a field type or array type, the object's type information is 
left out of the stream.  For example, a `String[]` looks like `["abc", "xyz"]`.

When an object's type must be emitted, it is emitted as a meta-object field `"@type":"package.class"` in the object.  
When read, this tells the JsonReader what class to instantiate.  (`@type` output can be turned off - see options below).

If an object is referenced more than once, or references an object that has not yet been defined, (say A points to B, 
and B points to C, and C points to A), it emits a `"@ref":n` where 'n' is the object's integer identity (with a 
corresponding meta entry `"@id":n` defined on the referenced object).  Only referenced objects have IDs in the JSON 
output, reducing the JSON String length.

### Performance
**json-io** was written with performance in mind.  In most cases **json-io** is faster than the JDK's
 `ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream`.  As the tests run, a log is written of the time it takes to 
 serialize / deserialize and compares it to `ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream` (if the static 
 variable `_debug` is `true` in `TestUtil`).

### Usage
**json-io** can be used directly on JSON Strings or with Java's Streams.

_Example 1: String to Java object_

    String json = // some JSON content
    Object obj = JsonReader.jsonToJava(json);     // optional 2nd 'options' argument (see below)

This will convert the JSON String to a Java Object graph.

_Example 2: Java object to JSON String_

    Employee emp;
    // Emp fetched from database
    String json = JsonWriter.objectToJson(emp);     // optional 2nd 'options' argument (see below)

This example will convert the `Employee` instance to a JSON String.  If the `JsonReader` were used on this `String`, 
it would reconstitute a Java `Employee` instance.

_Example 3: `InputStream` to Java object_

    Employee emp = (Employee) JsonReader.jsonToJava(stream);  // optional 2nd 'options' argument (see below)

In this example, an `InputStream` (could be from a File, the Network, etc.) is supplying an unknown amount of JSON.
If you want, you can use the `JsonReader` to wrap the stream to parse it, and return the Java object graph it 
represents. See constructors that take a Stream argument.

_Example 4: Java Object to `OutputStream`_

    Employee emp;
    // emp obtained from database
    JsonWriter jw = new JsonWriter(outputStream);       // optional 2nd 'options' argument (see below)
    jw.write(emp);
    jw.close();

In this example, a Java object is written to an output stream in JSON format.

### Non-typed Usage
**json-io** provides the choice to use the generic "Map of Maps" representation of an object, akin to a Javascript associative array.  When reading from a JSON String or `InputStream` of JSON, the `JsonReader` can be constructed like this:

    // shown using Groovy short-hand for Map of options.  See options below.
    String json = // some JSON obtained from wherever
    Object obj = JsonReader.jsonToJava(json, [(JsonReader.USE_MAPS): true])    

This will return an untyped object representation of the JSON String as a `Map` of Maps, where the fields are the
`Map` keys (Strings), and the field values are the associated Map's values. In this representation the returned data consists
of Maps, Arrays (Object[]), and JSON values.  The Maps are actually a `JsonObject` instance (from **json-io**).  This 
`JsonObject` implements the `Map` interface permitting access to the entire object.  Cast to a `JsonObject`, you can see 
the type information, position within the JSON stream, and other information.  

This 'Maps' representation can be re-written to a JSON String or Stream and _the output JSON will exactly match the
original input JSON stream_.  This permits a JVM receiving JSON strings / streams that contain class references which 
do not exist in the JVM that is parsing the JSON, to completely read / write the stream.  Additionally, the Maps can 
be modified before being written, and the entire graph can be re-written in one collective write.  _Any object model 
can be read, modified, and then re-written by a JVM that does not contain any of the classes in the JSON data._

### Customization

#### Customization technique 1: Custom serializer
New APIs have been added to allow you to associate a custom reader / writer class to a particular class if you want it 
to be read / written specially in the JSON output.  The **json-io** approach allows you to customize the JSON format for 
classes for which you do not have the source code.

    Example (in Groovy). Note the Person has a List of pets, and in this case, it re-uses 
    JsonWriter to write that part of the class out (no need to customize it):
    
    static class CustomPersonWriter implements JsonWriter.JsonClassWriterEx
    {
        void write(Object o, boolean showType, Writer output, Map<String, Object> args) throws IOException
        {
            Person p = (Person) o
            output.write('"first":"')
            output.write(p.getFirstName())
            output.write('","last":"')
            output.write(p.getLastName())
            JsonWriter writer = Support.getWriter(args)
            writer.writeImpl(p.getPets(), true)
        }
    }

#### Customization technique 2: Custom instantiator  `JsonReader.assignInstantiator(Class c, ClassFactoryEx)`
There are times when **json-io** cannot instantiate a particular class even though it makes many attempts to instantiate 
a class, including looping through all the constructors (public, private) and invoking them with default values, etc.  
However, sometimes a class just cannot be constructed, for example, one that has a constructor that throws an exception 
if particular parameters are not passed into it.
                                                                                  
In these instances, use the `JsonReader.assignInstantiator(class, Factory)` to assign a `ClassFactory` or `ClassFactoryEx` 
that you implement to instantiate the class. **json-io** will call your `ClassFactory.newInstance(Class c)` 
(or `ClassFactoryEx.newInstance(Class c, Map args)`) to create the class that it could not construct.  Your `ClassFactory` 
will be called to create the instance.  In case you need values from the object being instantiated in order to construct it,
use the `ClassFactoryEx` to instantiate it.  This class factory has the API `newInstance(Class c, Map args)` which will
be called with the Class to instantiate and the JSON object that represents it (already read in).  In the args `Map`, 
the key 'jsonObj' will have the associated `JsonObject` (`Map`) that is currently being read.  You can pull field values
from this object to create and return the instance.  After your code creates the instance, **json-io** will reflectively
stuff the values from the `jsonObj` (`JsonObject`) into the instance you create. 
 
#### Customization technique 3: Drop unwanted fields
Let's say a class that you want to serialize has a field on it that you do not want written out, like a `ClassLoader` reference.
Use the `JsonWriter.FIELD_SPECIFIERS` to associate a `List` of `String` field names to a particular `Class` C.  When the class
is being written out, only the fields you list will be written out.

#### Customization technique 4: Shorter meta-keys (@type -> @t, @id -> @i, @ref -> @r, @keys -> @k, @items -> @e)  
Set `JsonWriter.SHORT_META_KEYS` to `true` to see the single-letter meta keys used in the outputted JSON.  In addition
to the shorter meta keys, you can and a list of substitutions of your own to use.  For example, you may want to see 
`alist` instead of `java.util.ArrayList`.  This is only applicable if you are writing with @types in the JSON.

  
      Map args = [
              (JsonWriter.SHORT_META_KEYS):true,
              (JsonWriter.TYPE_NAME_MAP):[
                  'java.util.ArrayList':'alist', 
                  'java.util.LinkedHashMap':'lmap', 
                  (TestObject.class.getName()):'testO'
              ]
      ]
      String json = JsonWriter.objectToJson(list, args)
          
In this example, we create an 'args' `Map`, set the key `JsonWriter.SHORT_META_KEYS` to `true` and set the
`JsonWriter.TYPE_NAME_MAP` to a `Map` that will be used to substitute class names for short-hand names.         

#### Customization technique 5: Processing JSON from external sources.
When reading JSON from external sources, you may want to start with:

 in Groovy:
 
    Object data = JsonReader.jsonToJava(json, [(JsonReader.USE_MAPS): true])
    
In Java:

    Map args = new HashMap();
    args.put(JsonReader.USE_MAPS, true);
    Object data = JsonReader.jsonToJava(json, args);


This will get the JSON read into memory, in a Map-of-Maps format, similar to how JSON is read into memory in Javascript. 
This will get you going right away.
  
To write 'generic' JSON (without `@type` or `@items`, etc.) entries, use:

in Groovy:

    String json = JsonWriter.objectToJson(objToWrite, [(JsonWriter.TYPE):false])

In Java:

    Map args = new HashMap();
    args.put(JsonWriter.TYPE, false);
    String json = JsonWriter.objectToJson(objToWrite, args);
    
Objects will not include the `@type` flags or `@items`.  This JSON passes nicely to non-Java receivers, like Javascript. 
Keep in mind, you will be working with the JSON as generic `object.field` and `object[index]` with this approach.  

Please note that if you write your object graph out with `JsonWriter.TYPE: false`, the shape of the graph will be 
maintained.  What this means, is that if two different places in your object graph point to the same object, the first 
reference will write the actual object, the 2nd and later references will write a reference (`@ref`) to the first instance.
This will read in just fine with `JsonReader.jsonToJava()`, and the appropriate `Map` reference will be placed in all 
referenced locations.  If reading this in Javascript, make sure to use the included `jsonUtil.js` to parse the read in JSON
so that it can perform the substitutions of the `@ref`'s. (See `src/test/resource` folder for `jsonUtil.js`).

### Javascript
Included is a small Javascript utility (`jsonUtil.js` in the `src/test/resources` folder) that will take a JSON output 
stream created by the JSON writer and substitute all `@ref's` for the actual pointed to object.  It's a one-line 
call - `resolveRefs(json)`.  This will substitute `@ref` tags in the JSON for the actual pointed-to object.  

### What's next?
Even though **json-io** is perfect for Java / Javascript serialization, there are other great uses for it:

### Cloning
Many projects use `JsonWriter` to write an object to JSON, then use the `JsonReader` to read it in, perfectly cloning the original object graph:

    Employee emp;
    // emp obtained from database
    Employee deepCopy = (Employee) cloneObject(emp);

    public Object cloneObject(Object root)
    {
        return JsonReader.jsonToJava(JsonWriter.objectToJson(root));
    }

### Debugging
Instead of doing `System.out.println()` debugging, call `JsonWriter.objectToJson(obj)` and dump that String out.  It
will reveal the object in all it's glory.

### Pretty-Printing JSON
Use `JsonWriter.formatJson()` API to format a passed in JSON string to a nice, human readable format.  Also, when writing
JSON data, use the `JsonWriter.objectToJson(o, args)` API, where args is a `Map` with a key of `JsonWriter.PRETTY_PRINT`
and a value of 'true' (`boolean` or `String`).  When run this way, the JSON written by the `JsonWriter` will be formatted
in a nice, human readable format.

### RESTful support
**json-io** can be used as the fundamental data transfer method between a Javascript / JQuery / Ajax client and a web server
in a RESTful fashion. Used this way, you can create more active sites like Google's GMail, MyOtherDrive online backup, etc.

See https://github.com/jdereg/json-command-servlet for a light-weight servlet that processes Ajax / XHR calls.

### Revision History
 * 4.4.0
  * JsonReader.jsonToMaps() API is no longer recommended (not yet deprecated).  These can easily be turned into JsonReader.jsonToJava(json, [(JsonReader.USE_MAPS):true]).  The one difference is the return value will match the return value type of the JSON (not always be a Map).
 * 4.3.1
  * Enhancement: Skip null fields.  When this flag is set on the `JsonWriter` optional arguments, fields which have a null value are not written in the JSON output.
 * 4.3.0
  * Double / Float Nan and inifinity are now written as null, per RFC 4627
  * JsonReader.jsonToJava() can now be used to read input into Maps only (as opposed to attempting to create specific Java objects.
    Using this API allows the return value to support an array [], object, string, double, long, null as opposed to the JsonReader.jsonToMaps()
    API which forces the return value to be a Map.  May deprecate JsonReader.jsonToMaps() in the future.
 * 4.2.1
  * Bug fix: The error message showing any parsing errors put the first character of the message at the end of the message (off by one error on a ring buffer).
  * Parsing exceptions always include the line number and column number (there were a couple of places in the code that did not do this).
 * 4.2.0
  * Enhancement: In Map of Maps mode, all fields are kept, even if they start with @.  In the past fields starting with @ were skipped.
  * Ehancement: No longer throws ClassNotFound exception when the class associated to the @type is not found.  Instead it returns a LinkedHashMap, which works well in Map of Maps mode.  In Object mode, it *may* work if the field can have the Map set into it, otherwise an error will be thrown indicating that a Map cannot be set into field of type 'x'.
  * Bug fix: In Map of Maps mode, Object[] were being added with an @items field.  The object[] is now stored directly in the field holding it.  If an Object[] is 'pointed to' (re-used), then it will be written as an object { } with an @id identifying the object, and an @items field containing the array's elements.
 * 4.1.10
  * Enhancement: Java's EnumSet support added (submitted by @francisu) without need for using custom instantiator.
  * Enhancement: Added support for additional instantiator, ClassFactory2 that takes the Class (c) and the JsonObject which the instance will be filled from.  Useful for custom readers.
 * 4.1.9
  * Bug fix: When writing a Map that has all String keys, the keys were not being escaped for quotes (UTF-8 characters in general).
 * 4.1.8
  * Bug fix: 4.1.7 skipped ALL transient fields.  If a transient field is listed in the field specifiers map, then it must be traced. 
 * 4.1.7
  * Bug fix: Transient fields are skipped during reference tracing. (fix submitted by Francis Upton, @francisu).  Some transient fields could cause an exception to be thrown when being trace for references, stopping serialization.   
 * 4.1.6
  * Better support for primitive output when 'never show type' is set. (submitted by @KaiHufenbach)
 * 4.1.5
  * Tests updated to use Groovy 2.4.4
  * Deserialization updated to handle objects where the referencing class uses an Object pointer and writes the value out as single primitive value, using the 'value' key. (submitted by @KaiHufenbach)
  * pom filed updated to use a maven bundle plugin (Apache Felix) to generate OSGI headers (submitted by @KaiHufenbach)
 * 4.1.4
  * Bug fix: Custom readers will now always have the .target field set if a `JsonObject` is passed to them.  The custom reader's `read()` method was being called before the `.target` field was set on the `JsonObject`.
 * 4.1.3
  * Made `JsonReader / JsonWriter getObjectsReferenced()` API `public` (allows custom reader / writers access to these)
  * `Resolver.createJavaObjectInstance()`, used to create the correct Java object for a `JsonObject` peer, no longer calls the .read() API for objects's with custom readers.
 * 4.1.2
  * All objects in the graph are 'traced' (JsonWriter.traceReferences) except references.  The code used to not trace fields on objects that were handled by custom writers.
 * 4.1.1
  * JDK 1.6 support - Use of `ReflectiveOperationException` changed to `InvocationTargetException`.
 * 4.1.0
  * JDK 1.6 support restored. Keeping 1.6 support for Android developers.  Submitted by @kkalisz
 * 4.0.1
  * To prevent @type from being written, set the optional argument `JsonWriter.TYPE = false`. This is generally not recommended, as the output JSON may not be able to be re-read into Java objects.  However, if the JSON is destined for a non-Java system, this can be useful.
 * 4.0.0
  * Custom readers / writers are set now per-instance of `JsonReader` / `JsonWriter`, not static.  This allows using different customization for cloning, for example, than for serialization to client.
  * `JsonReader.jsonToJava()` and `JsonReader.jsonToMaps()` now allow an `InputStream` to be used.
  * Custom readers / writers can now be set all-at-once through the optional 'args' `Map`.
  * 'notCustom' readers / writers can now be set all-at-once through the optional 'args' `Map`.
  * The `removeReader()`, `removeWriter()`, `removeNotCustomReader()`, and `removeNotCustomWriter()` APIs have been removed since customizers are set per-instance. 
 * 3.3.2
  * Added new `JsonObject.isReference()` API which will return 'true' if the `JsonObject` is currently representing a reference `@ref`
  * Added new `JsonReader.getRefTarget(jsonObject)` API which will follow the `@ref` links until it resolves to the referenced (target) instance.
  * Added new `JsonReader()` constructor that only takes the args (`Map`).  It is expected that you will call `JsonReader.jsonObjectsToJava(rootJsonObject)` which will parse the passed in JsonObject graph.
  * Added new `JsonReader.removeReader()` API to remove a custom reader association to a given class.
  * Added new `JsonWriter.removeWriter()` API to remove a custom writer association to a given class.
  * Added new `JsonReader.removeNotCustomReader()` API to remove a `not custom` reader - if a `notCustom()` reader has been added (preventing inherited object from using custom reader), the association can be eliminated using this API.
  * Added new `JsonWriter.removeNotCustomWriter()` API to remove a `not custom` writer - if a `notCustom()` writer has been added (preventing inherited object from using custom writer), the association can be eliminated using this API.
 * 3.3.1
  * Re-entrancy issue fixed.  If a CustomReader (or CustomWriter) instantiated another copy of JsonReader or JsonWriter (indirectly, through recursion, for example), the 2nd instance of JsonReader or JsonWriter would clobber the ThreadLocal values inside JsonReader / JsonWriter.  Those ThreadLocal values have been removed and converted to per-instance member variables.
 * 3.3.0
  * Consolidate all 3.2.x changes
  * Last snippet read no longer shows 'boxes' for unused internal buffer characters.
  * `JsonWriter` - moved reference check 'up' to `writeImpl()` so that each specific 'write' routine did not have to test / call `writeOptionalReference()`.
  * If you have a custom reader that does not bother to resolve references from 'deeper' internal `JsonObject` maps, an exception will no longer be thrown.  It is OK for a custom reader not to 'care' about internal deeper fields if it wants to ignore them.
 * 3.2.3
  * Cache Map's for custom reader's updated to be `ConcurrentMap` instead of `Map`.
 * 3.2.2
  * `JsonCustomReaderEx` added, which passes the 'args' `Map` through to the custom reader.
  * Both `JsonCustomReaderEx` and `JsonCustomWriterEx` have a `Map` as the last argument in their single method that is implemented by the custom reader / writer.  This `Map` is the same as the 'args' `Ma` passed into to the `JsonReader` / `JsonWriter`, with the added `JSON_READER` or `JSON_WRITER` key and associated value of the calling `JsonReader` / `JsonWriter` instance.
 * 3.2.1
  * Made `Support.getWriter()` method `public static` so that CustomWriters can easily use it
  * Changed `JsonCustomWriterEx` to no longer inherit from `JsonCustomWriter` and instead added a common parent (`JsonCustomWriterBase`).  This allows only one method to be overridden to create a `JsonCustomWriterEx`.
 * 3.2.0
  * New `JsonCustomWriterEx` interface which adds the `JsonWriter` access to the implementing class so that it can call back and use `jsonWriter.writeImpl()` API.
  * Change `JsonWriter.writeImpl()` from protected to public
 * 3.1.3
  * Performance improvement: No longer using .classForName() inside JsonObject to determine isMap() or isCollection().  Reading JSON into Map of Maps mode significantly faster.
 * 3.1.2
  * Bug fix: Version 3.1.1 introduced a bug where it would always run as though it was in JSON to Java mode always (as opposed to supporting JSON to Maps).  This has been fixed.
 * 3.1.1 
  * `JsonReader.UNKNOWN_OBJECT` added as an option to indicate what to do when an unknown object is encountered in the JSON.  Default is a `Map` will be created.  However, you can set this argument to a `String` class name to instantiate, or set it to false to force an exception to be thrown.
 * 3.1.0
  * **New Feature**: Short class names to reduce the size of the output JSON. This allows you to, for example, substitute `java.util.HashMap` with `hmap` so that it will appear in the JSON as `"@type":"hmap"`.  Pass the substitution map to the `JsonWriter` (or reader) as an entry in the args `Map` with the key of `JsonWriter.TYPE_NAME_MAP` and the value as a `Map` instance with String class names as the keys and short-names as the values. The same map can be passed to the `JsonReader` and it will properly read the substituted types.
  * **New Feature**: Short meta-key names to reduce the size of the output JSON.  The `@type` key name will be shortened to `@t`, `@id` => `@i`, `@ref` => `@r`, `@keys` => `@k`, `@items` => `@e`.  Put a key in the `args` `Map` as `JsonWriter.SHORT_META_KEYS` with the value `true`.   
 * 3.0.2
  * Bug fix: Using a CustomReader in a Collection with at least two identical elements causes an exception (submitted by @KaiHufenbach).    
 * 3.0.1
  * Added new flag `JsonWriter.WRITE_LONGS_AS_STRINGS` which forces long/Long's to be written as Strings.  When sending JSON data to a Javascript, longs can lose precision because Javascript only maintains 53-bits of info (Javascript uses IEEE 754 `double` for numbers).  The precision is lost due to some of the bits used for maintaining an exponent.  With this flag set, longs will be sent as Strings, however, on return back to a Java server, json-io allows Strings to be set right back into long (fields, array elements, collections, etc.)
 * 3.0.0
   * Performance improvement: caching the custom readers and writes associated to given classes.
   * Ease of use: `json-io` throws a `JsonIoException` (unchecked) instead of checked exception `IOException`.  This allows more flexibility in terms of error handling for the user.
   * Code cleanup: Moved reflection related code from `JsonReader` into separate `MetaUtils` class.
   * Code cleanup: Moved `FastPushbackReader` from `JsonReader` into separate class.
   * Code cleanup: Moved JSON parsing code from `JsonReader` into separate `JsonParser` class.
   * Code cleanup: Moved built-in readers from `JsonReader` to separate `Readers` class.
   * Code cleanup: Moved resolver code (marshals map of maps to Java instances) into separate `Resolver` classes.
 * 2.9.4
  * `JsonReader.newInstance()` API made public
  * Bumped version of junit from 4.11 to 4.12
  * Added additional tests to ensure that null and "" can be properly assigned to primitive values (matching behavior of java-util's `Converter.convert()` API).
 * 2.9.3
  * Bug fix: When writing a `Map` with JSON primitive keys (`String`, `Long`, `Double`, or `Boolean`), a `ClassCastException` was being thrown if the type was `Long`, `Double`, or `Boolean`.  This has been fixed with test added.
 * 2.9.2
  * Android: Rearranged `[:.]` to `[.:]` in regular expressions for Android compatibility.  Technically, it should not matter, but `[:.]` was causing `java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException: Syntax error U_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT_ERROR` on Android JVM.
  * Bug fix: When using the `JsonWriter` arguments `Map` with `FIELD_SPECIFIERS`, if you specified a field that was transient, it was not serialized.  This has been corrected.  When you specify the field list for a given class, the `Map` can contain any non-static fields in the class, including transient fields.
  * All JUnit tests converted to Groovy.
 * 2.9.1
  * Bug fix: Parameterized types are only internally stamped onto generic Maps (Maps read with no `@type`) if the field that points to the `Map` is a template variable or it has template arguments.
  * Performance optimization: tracing references specially handles `Collection` and `Map`.  By avoiding internal structures, the reference trace is much faster.
 * 2.9.0
  * Unmodifiable `Collections` and `Maps` can now be serialized.
  * Added tests to ensure that `JsonReader.jsonToMaps()` coerces the RHS values when logical primitives, to the optional associated `@type's` fields.
  * More tests and improved code-coverage.
 * 2.8.1
  * Bug fix: `JsonReader.jsonToMaps()` API was incorrectly attempting to instantiate peer objects (specified by "@type" field in the JSON) when in 'maps' mode.  This made `JsonReader.jsonToMaps()` fail if all referenced class names did not exist in the JVM.  This has been fixed.
  * Minor Javadoc cleanup (Daniel Darabos @darabos)
  * Began migration of tests from one monolithic Java class (`TestJsonReaderWriter`) to individual Groovy test classes.
 * 2.8.0
  * Additional attempt to instantiate classes via `sun.misc.Unsafe` added (optional must be turned on by calling `JsonReader.setUseUnsafe(true)`). json-io already tries all constructors (private or public) with varying arguments, etc.  If this fails and unsafe is true, it will try `sun.misc.Unsafe.allocateInstance()` which effectively does a C-style `malloc()`.  This is OK, because the rest of `JsonReader` fills in the member variables from the serialized content.  (Submitted by @KaiHufenbach).
 * 2.7.6
  * Performance optimizations.  Use of switch statement instead of if-else chains.
  * JDK 1.7 for source code and target JVM.
 * 2.7.5
  * Bug fix: ArrayIndexOutOfBounds could still occur when serializing a class with multiple Templated fields.  The exception has been fixed.
 * 2.7.4
  * Bug fix: ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception occurring when serializing non-static inner class with nested template parameters.  JsonReader was incorrectly passing on the 'this$0' field for further template argument processing when it should not have.
 * 2.7.3
  * `JsonReader` executes faster (more efficiently manages internal 'snippet' buffer and last line and column read.)
  * Improved date parsing: day of week support (long or short name), days with suffix (3rd, 25th, etc.), Java's default `.toString()` output for `Date` now parses, full time zone support, extra whitespace allowed within the date string.
  * Added ability to have custom JSON writers for interfaces (submitted by @KaiHufenbach).
 * 2.7.2
  * When writing JSON, less memory is used to manage referenced objects.  `JsonWriter` requires a smaller memory foot print during writing.
  * New option available to JsonWriter that allows you to force enums to not write private variables.  First you can make them transient.  However, if you do not own the code or cannot change it, you can set the `JsonWriter.getArgs().put(ENUM_PUBLIC_ONLY, true)`, and then only public fields on enums will be emitted.
 * 2.7.1
  * `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` are now always written as a primitive (immutable, non-referenced) value.  This uniformizes their output.
 * 2.7.0
  * Updated to support JSON root of `String`, `Integer`, Floating point, and `Boolean`, per the updated JSON RFP.  Example, the `String` "football" is considered valid JSON.  The `JsonReader.readObject()` API and `JsonReader.jsonToJava()` will return a `String` in this case.  The `JsonReader.jsonToMaps()` API will still return a `Map (JsonObject)`, and the `@items` key will contain an `Object[]` with the single value (`String, Integer, Double, Boolean`) in it.
  * When a Java `Map` has only `String` keys in it, json-io will use the JSON object keys directly and associate the values to the keys as expected.  For example, the `Map` ['Football':true] would be written `{"Football":true}`.  However, if the keys are non-Strings, then Maps will be written as a JSON object with `{"@keys":[...], "@items":[...]}`, where `@keys` is an array [] of all the keys, and the `@items` is an array [] of all the values.  Entry 0 of `@keys` matches with Entry 0 in the `@items` array, and so on.  Thanks for Christian Reuschling for making the request and then supplying the implementation.
  * Change some APIs from `private` to `protected` to allow for subclasses to more easily override the default behavior.
 * 2.6.1
  * Bug fix: An internal `Map` that kept meta-information about a Java Class, changed to `ConcurrentHashMap` from `HashMap`.
 * 2.6.0
  * Added support for specifying which fields on a class will be serialized.  Use the `JsonWriter.FIELD_SPECIFIERS` key and assign the value to a `Map<Class, List<String>>`, where the keys of the `Map` are classes (e.g. Bingo.class) and the values are `List<String>`, which indicates the fields to serialize for the class.  This provides a way to reduce the number of fields written for a given class.  For example, you may encounter a 3rd Party class which fails to serialize because it has an oddball field like a `ClassLoader` reference as a non-static, non-transient field. You may not have access to the source code to mark the field as `transient`. In this case, add the appropriate entries in the `FIELD_SPECIFIERS` map. Voila, problem solved. Use the `JsonWriter` API that takes `optionalArgs Map`.  The key for this `Map` is `JsonWriter.FIELD_SPECIFIER` and the value is `Map<Class, List<String>>`.
 * 2.5.2
  * `java.net.URL` can now be used as a constructor argument.  The reader was throwing an exception instantiating a constructor with a `URL` parameter.
  * `java.lang.Object` parameters in constructor arguments are now tried with both null and `new Object()` now.
 * 2.5.1
  * Fixed a bug (introduced in 2.5.0) in the processing of a `Map` that has a `Collection` as a key.
 * 2.5.0
  * New 'Pretty-Print' option available.  If the 'args' Map passed to `JsonWriter.objectToJson(o, args)` contains the key `JsonWriter.PRETTY_PRINT` and the value 'true' (`boolean` or `String`), the `JsonWriter` output will be formatted in a nice human readable format.
  * Convert a JSON String to Pretty-Print format using `JsonWriter.formatJson(String json)`.  A `String` will be returned with the JSON formatted in a nice, human readable format.
  * If a Field contains Parameterized types (e.g., `Map<String, Set<Long>>`, and so on), `JsonReader` will use those fields to process objects deep within Maps, Collections, etc. and still create the proper Java class.
 * 2.4.5
  * Allow "" to be set into `Date` field, setting the `Date` field (or `Date` array element) as null.
 * 2.4.4
  * Allow "" to be set into `BigInteger` or `BigDecimal` when return value is `Map` (`JsonObject`). "" to non-String fields will be null, except for primitives and primitive wrappers, that will result in JVM default value.
 * 2.4.2
  * Allow "" to be set into non-String fields, when doing so, null is set on Object type fields; on primitive fields, the JVM default value is set. This is for when converting JSON to Java objects directly.
 * 2.4.1
  * Added support to allow primitives and `String` to be assigned to abstract / interface / base type field on an object (`Serializable`, `Comparable`, `Object`, etc.). Primitives can now be 'set' into these fields, without any additional type information.
 * 2.4.0
  * Primitives can be set from `Strings`
  * `Strings` can be set from primitives
  * `BigDecimal` and `BigInteger` can be set from primitives, `Strings`, `BigDecimal`, or `BigInteger`
 * 2.3.0
  * `Maps` and `Collections` (`Lists`, `Set`, etc.) can be read in, even when there are no `@keys` or `@items` as would come from a Javascript client.
  * **json-io** will now use the generic info on a `Map<Foo, Bar>` or `Collection<Foo>` object's field when the `@type` information is not included. **json-io** will then know to create `Foo` instances, `Bar` instances, etc. within the `Collection` or `Map`.
  * All parsing error messages now output the last 100 characters read, making it easier to locate the problem in JSON text. Furthermore, line and column number are now included (before it was a single position number). This allows you to immediately find the offending location.
  * You can now force `@type` to be written (not recommended) by putting the `JsonWriter.TYPE` key in the `JsonWriter` args map, and assigning the associated value to `true`.
 * 2.2.32
  * Date/Time format can be customized when writing JSON output. New optional `Map args` parameter added to main API of `JsonWriter` that specifies additional parameters for `JsonWriter`. Set the key to `JsonWriter.DATE_FORMAT` and the value to a `SimpleDateFormat` string.  Two ISO formats are available for convenience as constants on `JsonWriter`, `JsonWriter.ISO_DATE_FORMAT` and `JsonWriter.ISO_DATE_TIME_FORMAT`.
  * `JsonReader` updated to read many different date/time formats.
  * When `JsonReader` encounters a class that cannot be constructed, you can associate a `ClassFactory` to the class, so that then the un-instantiable class is encountered, your factory class will be called to create the class. New API: `JsonReader.assignInstantiator(Class c, ClassFactory factory)`
 * 2.2.31
  * Adds ability to instantiate a wider range of constructors. This was done by attempting construction with both null and non-null values for many common class types (`Collections`, `String`, `Date`, `Timezone`, etc.)
 * 2.2.30
  * `java.sql.Date` when read in, was instantiated as a `java.util.Date`. This has been corrected.
 * 2.2.29
  * First official release through Maven Central
